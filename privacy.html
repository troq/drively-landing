  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
WE DO NOT STORE ANY DATA ABOUT YOU OR YOUR GOOGLE DRIVE.  PERIOD.
</p>

  <p>
We physically can’t.  We have nowhere to store it.  We don’t even have a server database to store it.  So even if Justin Bieber asked nicely to see your data, we wouldn’t have anything to show him.
That’s why, with Drively, what happens on your computer stays on your computer.
  </p>

  <p>
Whenever you want to read from or write to your Google Drive, the extension uses the chrome.identity API and stores the response data locally in your browser — there's no way for us to access the data. No middleman is between your communications.  We’re proud to be able to say this.
  </p>

  <p>
We do not save your email or any other information about you. The Google Drive oAuth2 process is managed through the chrome.identity extension API.

<p>You can confirm for yourself by reading the sourcecode at <a href="https://github.com/troq/drively">https://github.com/troq/drively</a>.</p>
